**N.B:** _If you are using Linux, you may need to make the .exe file executable: Simply run this command in your terminal: chmod +x env/AnimalAI.x86_64. If you are using MacOS, you may also need to run this command: chmod -R 777 [applicationName].app in your MacOS terminal to unlock permissions for running the application. Edit: Please also make sure when you extract the folder, you move the files inside the sub-directory to its parent folder._
